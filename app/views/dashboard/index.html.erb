<h2>Welcome to <%= SITE_NAME %>!</h2>

<p>This is a pre-Beta version of the <%= SITE_NAME %> software.  All of the data here is
generated and most of it is nonsensical.  However, it is a starting point and 
should give you enough 'things' to be able to exercise the program a little bit.
Please, take a look around and push all the buttons.  You can't hurt anything here.
If you find something interesting, please <a href='mailto:gradesheet@kangaroobox.com'>let us know about it</a>.</p>

<h3>Latest News - Feb. 26, 2009</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Wow, there has been quite a bit going on this week.  Everything from the look
  and feel of the buttons to tightening down what you can delete has been touched.</li>
  <li>First off take a look at the buttons.  They are a little bit more subtle and
  hopefully look semi-good across different browsers/operating systems.  It is 
  amazingly difficult to get this working correctly.</li>
  <li>The next big thing is we are now preventing some things from being deleted if
  there are other things depending on them.  For example, you should not be able
  to delete a course if that course has assignments.  And now you can't.  We even
  let you know that you can't remove it by disabling the button.  Cool!</li>
  <li><%= link_to 'Grading Periods', terms_path %> and <%= link_to 'Grading Scales', grading_scales_path %> 
  are now editable.  They don't do much at the momemnt but we are working hard on 
  getting them integrated into the system.  They should be up and functional 
  within the next week or so.  Stay tuned!</li>
</ul>

<h3>News - Feb. 19, 2009</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The <%= link_to "Settings", settings_path %> section is getting heavy attention right
  now and we hope to be fully operational within the week.  It is already looking pretty
  good and you should be able to edit the grading period with abandon.  Notice that when
  you deactivate a particular grading period all the courses that are in that period are
  no longer editable.</li>
  <li>The left side columns are actually computing real dates now based on the grading periods.
  So if you come back tomorrow the numbers should change.  Very cool!</li>
</ul>

<h3>News - Feb. 13, 2009</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The <%= link_to "Reports", reports_path %> page is now up and working. 
  		The "Student Roster" report shows a listing of every student in every class. 
  		The "Report Card" report is in heavy development and
  		will be available for testing in the next week or so.</li>
  <li>I am trying a couple of new things with the left side column on this page.  How do you
  	like them?  What would you like to see there?</li>
</ul>

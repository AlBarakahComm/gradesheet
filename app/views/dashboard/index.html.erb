<h2>Welcome to <%= SITE_NAME %>!</h2>

<p>This is a pre-Beta version of the <%= SITE_NAME %> software.  All of the data here is
generated and most of it is non-sensical.  However, it is a starting point and 
should give you enough 'things' to be able to excercise the program a little bit.
Please, take a look around and push all the buttons.  You can't hurt anything here.
If you find something interesting, please <a href='mailto:gradesheet@kangaroobox.com'>let us know about it</a>.</p>

<h3>Latest News - Feb. 19, 2009</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The <%= link_to "Settings", settings_path %> section is getting heavy attention right
  now and we hope to be fully operational within the week.  It is already looking pretty
  good and you should be able to edit the grading period with abandon.  Notice that when
  you deactivate a particular grading period all the courses that are in that period are
  no longer editable.</li>
  <li>The left side columns are actually computing real dates now based on the grading periods.
  So if you come back tomorrow the numbers should change.  Very cool!</li>
</ul>

<h3>News - Feb. 13, 2009</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The <%= link_to "Reports", reports_path %> page is now up and working. 
  		The "Student Roster" report shows a listing of every student in every class. 
  		The "Report Card" report is in heavy development and
  		will be available for testing in the next week or so.</li>
  <li>I am trying a couple of new things with the left side column on this page.  How do you
  	like them?  What would you like to see there?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Welcome to the Gradesheet program.</h2>

<p>
This is a pre-Beta version of the GradeSheet software.  All of the data here is
generated and most of it is non-sensical.  However, it is a starting point and 
should give you enough 'things' to be able to excercise the program a little bit.
Please, take a look around and push all the buttons.  You can't hurt anything here.
If you find something interesting, please <a href='mailto:gradesheet@kangaroobox.com'>let us know about it</a>.</p>

<p>
Thank you!<br />
